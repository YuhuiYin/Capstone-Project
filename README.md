# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
## Installation
The following libraries should be installed: sklearn, seaborn.

## Project Motivation
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\
In this project, I did exploratory analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. And at the same time, I applied the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\
This project is inspired by the competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to this project.\
In addition, there is a data folder containing data used in this project as well as a csv document containing the result of my prediction.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found [here](https://medium.com/@yuhui6yin/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-aa32b81eda7c).
